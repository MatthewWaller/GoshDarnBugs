# Gosh darn bugs!

GoshDarnBugs is a collection of... you guessed it, bugs.

## Why?

SwiftUI is an absolutely fantastic framework, a culmination of several years' worth of effort by many, many amazing and talented Apple engineers. Being a radical departure from traditional Cocoa/Touch frameworks, it is quite nascent and (understandably) still finding stability in terms of API design and an overall bug-free experience. 

Working with SwiftUI feels like standing on the bleeding edge. It's a new, beautiful, inspired way of writing code - and feels like a clean slate in terms of typical usage and best practices. A lot of us are trying to find our footing within this new framework, and there is certainly a lot confusing. However, it is sometimes frustrating to find that what *seems* confusing and misunderstood may simply belie a bug in the beta.

While SwiftUIX attempts to fill the gaps of SwiftUI in terms of available APIs, GoshDarnBugs attempts to offer an exhaustive, demonstrable collection of SwiftUI bugs (up-to-date with the latest Xcode beta).
